Mathematical Analysis on Health Care dataset to classify malignancy of cancerous cells and predicting their appearance time . Analyzed large amounts of data to observe trends and patterns for binary classification of cells and predicting the appearance time for malignant cells . Visualization of the correlation coefficients between the features using heat maps to omit features having similarity value above the threshold value of 0.8 . Reduced the features and devised the Ensemble Modelling to enhance the overall performance through minimizing the noise, bias and variance . Minimized the type-2 error (False-Negative) and improved the classification accuracy from 81% to 94% with F1-score of 0.93 on the test data-set
